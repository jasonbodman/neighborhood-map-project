# Neighborhood Map Project

## Project Description
The project is a part of Udacity's Full-Stack Nanodegree program and challenges the developer to create an interactive application that displays a list of locations, and various bits of data about that location, on a map using multiple third-party API services including Google Maps and Foursquare. This project utilizes Knockout JS which helps to organize the project using the MVVM (Model, View, ViewModel) structure. Additionally, this project makes asynchronus calls to avoid reloading all of the application's data during the user experience.
